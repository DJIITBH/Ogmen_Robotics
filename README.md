## Attempted in ROS2
# Run the reading_laser.py file seperately in VScode as it is not in executable format!
To spawn the robot in gazebo
```
ros2 launch bot_description spawn.launch.py
ros2 launch bot_description rviz.launch.py

```
Inside bot_control there is script reading_laser.py for publishing the filtered laser scan data as it is not in executable format so kindly run it manually.
